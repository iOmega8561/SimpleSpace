# SimpleSpace
SimpleSpace is a tool to explore the space and know more about <strong>astronomical objects</strong>.  

The application is meant to be a demostration project to explore <strong>visionOS</strong> capabilities, and is the product of a combined effort to offer an example solution to common spatial computing challenges. This project targets the following challenges of Apple Vision Pro development:
- Using an <strong>iOS application</strong> as the foundation of a visionOS project,
- Improving navigation, adopting a more space-filling oriented approach,
- Exploring <strong>Volumetric Views</strong> and their lifecycle/management,
- Exploring <strong>Immersive Spaces</strong> and their lifecycle/management,
- Learning to use physical <strong>tracking capabilities</strong> of visionOS,
- Implementing <strong>custom gestures</strong> that can be used to trigger events,
- Facing <strong>resource management</strong> and background tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is intended as a foundational starting point for further development. While the core functionality is implemented, it <strong>purposely</strong> lacks the robustness, optimizations, and quality that might be expected from a production solution.
>
> We recommend using this as a basis for experimentation and learning ðŸš€

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Xcode 16.0+
- VisionOS 2.0+

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To be able to experience the hand traking feature, a <strong>physical device</strong> may be needed.

### Building the project
- Clone the repository using ```git clone https://github.com/iOmega8561/SimpleSpace```
- Open SimpleSpace.xcodeproj
- Build the application
- Enjoy
