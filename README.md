# SimpleSpace 🌌

SimpleSpace is a lightweight exploration tool that lets you discover and interact with **astronomical objects** in a spatial environment.
Originally built as a learning project, it showcases what **visionOS** can do and provides a practical example of how to approach spatial computing challenges in Apple Vision Pro development.

## What This Project Demonstrates 🚀

SimpleSpace focuses on experimenting with the core areas of spatial app design:

* Building a visionOS project from an **existing iOS app**
* Adopting navigation patterns that embrace **spatial layouts**
* Working with **Volumetric Views** and managing their lifecycle
* Creating and controlling **Immersive Spaces**
* Using **tracking capabilities** of visionOS hardware
* Implementing **custom gestures** to trigger interactions
* Handling **resource management** and background tasks

> [!NOTE]
> SimpleSpace is a learning-driven project. It’s not optimized, hardened, or production-ready by design.
> Treat it as a sandbox for experimentation and prototyping.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* **Xcode 16.0+**
* **visionOS 2.0+**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hand-tracking features require a **physical Vision Pro device** for full functionality.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iOmega8561/SimpleSpace
   ```
2. Open `SimpleSpace.xcodeproj`
3. Build and run the app
4. Explore the cosmos ✨
